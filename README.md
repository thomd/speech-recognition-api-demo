# Simple Demo for the Speech Recognition API

This demo has a lot of technical overhead for no reason - it's definitely overengineered:

* [Express][2] Web Framework for [Node][3]
* [express-status-monitor][4] Realtime Monitoring for Express
* React
* Webpack
* PostCSS
* Moderizr

## Usage

Start application with

    npm start

Run application with `http://localhost:3000` and application status with `http://localhost:3000/status` in browser.
